The first factor was above average snowpack especially over the Minnesota River Valley for mid March. Additionally the added effect of a cold late Winter kept this snowpack deeper into the early Spring. Once temperatures warmed and snow began to melt a few storms especially around the 12-13th of March led to additional water on the already heavy snowpack. As area rivers streams and creeks began to thaw ice jams developed which led to more areal flooding beyond the flooded river beds. ||Area streams creeks and mainstem rivers started to break up their Winter ice the second week of March with a sharp rise in these basins during the three week sof March as the storm system around the 12th and 13th of March led to the ripening of the snowpack.

The Mississippi River crested after the last week of March from St. Paul and points downstream.||During the third week of March the Minnesota Department of Transportation started to close roads along mainstem rivers.

Therefore snowfall amounts were limited to locally 6 to 9 inches where the best forcing and lift occurred as the surface low tracked across eastern Iowa and into southern/eastern Wisconsin.  Wind speeds were generally 15-30 mph with blowing and drifting snow in open areas.||In Minnesota the highest totals were in the Twin Cities metro which received 9-11 inches of snow based on public and trained observers.

The storm started Friday morning January 17th with a surge of initial deep moisture advecting northward across the Upper Midwest. A dry layer at mid-levels kept the snowfall across southwest and south central Minnesota before this layer saturated by noon. There was a 3 to 5 hour period of heavy snowfall that produced snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour. A few areas in southwest Minnesota had already received 4 to 6 inches of snow before noon. This area of snow moved northeast and caused heavy snow bands across east central and central Minnesota as well as west central Wisconsin by the afternoon. As quickly as the snow started it ended by the late afternoon and early evening as a dry slot at mid-levels cutoff any ice crystal producing clouds. This dry slot and the accompany freezing drizzle once the snow ended caused a layer of ice to form on the snow that fell earlier.||By sunrise ice crystal producing clouds spread across the Upper Midwest as the main upper storm moved across the area. Periods of light snow fell across the region but most of the accumulating snowfall had ended. The cold front moved across Minnesota and into western Wisconsin by noon. Temperatures fell 10 to 20 degrees behind this front along with strong gusty winds developing. These winds created significant blowing and drifting snow in western Wisconsin especially in open country. The winds slowly abated during the evening but blowing snow continued.||A strong arctic cold front moved across Minnesota from before sunrise in the far west to eastern Minnesota by late morning.

A cold front moved as far south as southeast Minnesota and west central Wisconsin before stalling Saturday night. A surface low developed across Colorado Saturday before intensifying and moving east-northeast across the plains and into the Great Lakes by Sunday night. Most of central and southern Minnesota as well as west central Wisconsin were in the cold side of this storm system. Only the far southeast part had enough warm air to cause some mixing of sleet and rain before changing over to snow Sunday. This was noted with the next day visible satellite image which had a sharp cutoff of where no snow accumulated in the far southeast part of Minnesota. ||Due to the initial weak short waves ahead of the main storm system moving out into the plains Sunday morning some light snow began in portions of southwest and south central Minnesota. Most of the snowfall prior to sunrise Sunday was light with light accumulations. Once stronger forcing develop Sunday morning does the snowfall intensity increase. The initial band of heavier snowfall was noted in south central Minnesota where 3 to 6 inches fell before early Sunday afternoon. By the afternoon a secondary band of heavier snowfall began in southwest Minnesota and slowly moved eastward during the afternoon and into the early evening across west central Wisconsin before weakening. This band of heavier snowfall was related to strong forcing in the 850-700 MB layer. Snowfall amounts of 6 inches or more occurred in this band by the mid afternoon before  it tapered off and moved east into Wisconsin.

Total snow accumulations of up to 1-3 inches ice accumulations ranging from a tenth to two tenths of an inch and winds gusting to 35 mph were reported.||Using CoCoRaHS reports and Mn511 road condition reports social media reports and traffic cameras areas mainly from the Twin Cities metro and northward received freezing rain. A few photos shared on social media showed ice accretion on small tree branches as well as sidewalks/driveways having a thin layer of ice. Farther north a few spinouts were captured on Mn511 traffic cameras near Hwy 610 at Elm Creek Blvd and spinouts were reported along the I-94 corridor between Maple Grove MN and Clearwater MN.,,29.811206540502575,29.811206540502575,29.811206540502575,10000.0,44.914573,-93.162525,PV Output,5.85,3/22/2011 12:50,3/22/2023 12:40,4359,23,ac_power_inv_16421,2.7797844444807995

Part 1 of this system was widespread fluffy snow with high snow-to-liquid ratios from southwest through east central Minnesota. ||There was a break and then part 2 of this system followed as strong arctic winds developed in wrap-around circulation of the low-pressure system. Wind gusts of 35-50 mph with the highest amounts in western and southern Minnesota. These winds together with the arctic air and fresh snow led to dangerous wind-chills of -25 to -35��F and blizzard conditions across the open terrain of the Minnesota River Valley. Roads became impassable due to reports of snow drifts measuring 5 to 10 feet tall and nearly 40 feet long in some areas and zero visibility in multiple counties across Western MN. Whiteout conditions forced many roads to close. Highway 71 in Redwood County remained closed for approximately 36 hours after the storm had passed. The National Guard was called upon to perform rescue missions stranded motorists Kandiyohi and Renville Counties. One Kandiyohi County rescue case involved a stranded motorist who was diagnosed with critical hypothermia after being exposed in dangerous conditions for nearly nine hours. ||Rescued motorists were housed in various locations for their safety as the storm passed. In Renville County approximately 50 people were housed at the Olivia Armory in Oliva MN. Watonwan County opened emergency shelters in Medelia MN and Saint James MN.

The density of the snowpack also exacerbated the quality of snow to absorb the red end of the visible light spectrum transmitting the blue end which led to many folks observing a glacier blue color in holes and cracks in the snow as they cleared it.

This storm was unique in that widespread blizzard conditions occurred across the upper Midwest including areas from the Brainerd Lakes east towards the North Shore Twin Ports and Interstate 35 corridor with many observed wind gusts between 50 and 70 mph. Very strong frontogenesis occurred along a trowal axis that extended across much of northern Wisconsin west into Minnesota. Warm air advection caused temperatures across most of east-central Minnesota to rise above freezing and produce mixed precipitation for several hours during the day. As the cold front gradually moved east temperatures very quickly dropped and caused treacherous road conditions as mixed precipitation changed over to snow. Narrow bands of heavy snow set up over the Brainerd Lakes northeast towards the Iron Range during the early morning and early afternoon and then translated east towards the Twin Ports North Shore and Interstate 35 corridor. The heavy snow bands coincided with the strong mid-level frontogenesis which also produced very strong northwest winds that caused the widespread blizzard conditions. A maximum gust of 70 mph was recorded at the Bay of Grand Marais during the height of the storm. Damage was reported to buildings and other infrastructure in addition to some power outages and widespread whiteout conditions that made travel difficult if not impossible.||As the cold front swept rapidly eastward bitterly cold air moved into the region and led to the development of a topographically-forced gravity wave during the night of the 23rd that dropped several more inches of snow from Two Harbors to Superior to Holyoke.

This storm was unique in that widespread blizzard conditions occurred across the upper Midwest including areas from the Brainerd Lakes east towards the North Shore Twin Ports and Interstate 35 corridor with many observed wind gusts between 50 and 70 mph. Very strong frontogenesis occurred along a trowal axis that extended across much of northern Wisconsin west into Minnesota. Warm air advection caused temperatures across most of east-central Minnesota to rise above freezing and produce mixed precipitation for several hours during the day. As the cold front gradually moved east temperatures very quickly dropped and caused treacherous road conditions as mixed precipitation changed over to snow. Narrow bands of heavy snow set up over the Brainerd Lakes northeast towards the Iron Range during the early morning and early afternoon and then translated east towards the Twin Ports North Shore and Interstate 35 corridor. The heavy snow bands coincided with the strong mid-level frontogenesis which also produced very strong northwest winds that caused the widespread blizzard conditions. A maximum gust of 70 mph was recorded at the Bay of Grand Marais during the height of the storm. Damage was reported to buildings and other infrastructure in addition to some power outages and widespread whiteout conditions that made travel difficult if not impossible.||As the cold front swept rapidly eastward bitterly cold air moved into the region and led to the development of a topographically-forced gravity wave during the night of the 23rd that dropped several more inches of snow from Two Harbors to Superior to Holyoke.

Preliminary damage estimates were around three million dollars and approximately 85000 homes and businesses lost power. Power was not fully restored until September 1st. The combination of heavy rain and wind closed numerous roadways across the Eastern Shore and downed thousands of trees. Some schools were unable to open on Monday August 29th. There was a temporary ban on harvesting shellfish along Chesapeake Bay because of the excessive runoff.  Some tomato corn watermelon and cantaloupe crops were destroyed. It was estimated that 30000 chickens were also killed by the effects of Irene.||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread the Eastern Shore during the afternoon and early evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged 50 to 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening and late night of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground.

Event precipitation totals averaged from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches with the highest amounts in Cecil County. This caused poor drainage and field flooding as well as flooding of some creeks mainly in Cecil County. Creek flooding in parts of Cecil County were the highest since Tropical Storm Floyd in September of 1999 and persisted into the early morning on May 1st. The flow up the Chesapeake Bay coupled with spring astronomical tides associated with the new moon also caused minor tidal flooding. The steady rain began during the afternoon of April 29th and fell at its heaviest during the morning and afternoon of April 30th. The rain ended during the evening of April 30th.||Minor tidal flooding in Chesapeake Bay occurred during both high tide cycles on April 30th and the morning high tide cycle on May 1st. The highest tides occurred with the late afternoon and evening high tide cycle on April 30th. At Tolchester Beach the highest tide reached 3.82 feet above mean lower low water at 842 p.m. EDT on April 30th. Minor tidal flooding starts at 3.5 feet above mean lower low water.||The heavy rain and tidal flooding were caused by the combination of a strong high pressure system that built over the Canadian Maritimes that initiated the onshore flow and a strong but slow moving low pressure system. The low pressure system was located in northwest Missouri on the morning of April 29th. It moved northeast to near Chicago during the afternoon of April 29th. The low pressure system then became nearly stationary in southern Wisconsin as its cold front reached Ohio early on April 30th. Then a new low pressure system developed on the frontal boundary and was over Eastern Tennessee on the morning of April 30th.

Most of the damages were due to flooding caused by excessive rainfall as up to 13 inches of rain were reported and due to the high winds which caused trees and wires to come down across the state. Delmarva Power which serves portions of the eastern shore counties reported over 30000 households without power during the peak of the storm. The majority of residents had power returned by the morning of the 30th. Hundreds of roads were closed due to numerous downed trees and flooding. | |No direct deaths were reported on the Eastern Shore of Maryland due to the storm.||Tropical Storm Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on the 22nd of October.  After drifting slowly southwest into the 23rd Sandy turned to the north and intensified to a hurricane on the 24th just before making landfall in Jamaica during that afternoon. Hurricane Sandy continued to the north and intensified to a strong category two hurricane before making landfall again in Cuba shortly after Midnight EDT on the 25th.  Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th.  Overnight on the 26th Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north-northeast a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th.  From there Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east.  Simultaneously an approaching and deepening middle latitude trough was about to capture Sandy. The combination of the two turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th.  Hurricane Sandy received one last jolt of tropical energy as it passed across the Gulf Stream during the morning of the 29th. The lowest recorded central pressure of 940 millibars (27.76 inches) occurred when ,,27.7568395465868,27.7568395465868,27.7568395465868,10001.0,39.483937,-76.301594,PV Output,3.36,3/29/2011 6:05,3/7/2023 12:10,581,3779,ac_power_inv_16422,0.0

Preliminary damage estimates were around three million dollars and approximately 85000 homes and businesses lost power. Power was not fully restored until September 1st. The combination of heavy rain and wind closed numerous roadways across the Eastern Shore and downed thousands of trees. Some schools were unable to open on Monday August 29th. There was a temporary ban on harvesting shellfish along Chesapeake Bay because of the excessive runoff.  Some tomato corn watermelon and cantaloupe crops were destroyed. It was estimated that 30000 chickens were also killed by the effects of Irene.||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread the Eastern Shore during the afternoon and early evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged 50 to 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening and late night of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the Eastern Shore between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th.

Preliminary damage estimates were around three million dollars and approximately 85000 homes and businesses lost power. Power was not fully restored until September 1st. The combination of heavy rain and wind closed numerous roadways across the Eastern Shore and downed thousands of trees. Some schools were unable to open on Monday August 29th. There was a temporary ban on harvesting shellfish along Chesapeake Bay because of the excessive runoff.  Some tomato corn watermelon and cantaloupe crops were destroyed. It was estimated that 30000 chickens were also killed by the effects of Irene.||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread the Eastern Shore during the afternoon and early evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged 50 to 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening and late night of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the Eastern Shore between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 6 to 12 inches and caused widespread field and roadway flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one all flooding related county entries were combined into one under flood events.  ||On August 25 Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley declared a state of emergency in preparation for Irene. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic. In Queen Anne's County in Queenstown an 88-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on a chimney sending bricks through the ,,27.7568395465868,19.73634766049492,19.73634766049492,10001.0,39.483937,-76.301594,PV Output,3.36,3/29/2011 6:05,3/7/2023 12:10,151,4209,ac_power_inv_16422,1.3205043629494138

As a deep trough moved into the Southeast US low pressure began to develop off the coast of the Carolinas during the afternoon of January 28. A high amplitude upper level steering pattern caused the developing low to begin moving north-northeastward paralleling the US East Coast. In a classic Nor���easter evolution the developing low phased with a frontal system over the mid-Atlantic as it moved north. This frontal system had brought light snow to portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day on the 28th and it also brought a fresh influx of cold air to the region. As it phased with the developing coastal storm the coastal storm began to explosively intensify as it passed offshore of Delmarva. The strengthening storm spread precipitation back into the region which fell as all snow thanks to the fresh injection of Arctic air. With the center of the low passing a few hundred miles offshore the heaviest snow fell near the coast from the night of the 28th through the morning of the 29th.

In addition with the rapid strengthening of the low strong winds also occurred especially near the coast. Gusts of 40 to 50 mph with a few over 60 mph were observed. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow led to whiteout conditions along the coast and was sufficient for blizzard criteria to be met along both the New Jersey coast and the Delaware Beaches making this the first blizzard to affect any portion of the region since 2018.
