The first factor was above average snowpack especially over the Minnesota River Valley for mid March. Additionally the added effect of a cold late Winter kept this snowpack deeper into the early Spring. Once temperatures warmed and snow began to melt a few storms especially around the 12-13th of March led to additional water on the already heavy snowpack.

This band of precipitation had thunder sleet and heavy snow that produced several inches of snow across portions of southern and central Minnesota. Most of the heavier precipitation tapered off in the southern quarter of Minnesota with light snow continuing across central Minnesota during the afternoon and evening of Thursday April 11th.  ||The second wave of precipitation developed in far southern Minnesota after midnight Thursday morning April 11th.

A 500 MB short wave that developed across the central Rockies was moving northeast across Nebraska with an intensifying 850 MB low developing across Iowa Tuesday morning. At the surface low pressure was across northern Missouri. Initially the 850 MB low moved northward across Iowa and stronger warm air advection across eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin kept the precipitation in the form of sleet freezing rain and some snow Tuesday morning. Farther to the west and deeper into the colder air light snow fell but it was mostly flurries or occasionally 2-4 mile visibility in light snow.  ||A dry slot developed and moved over eastern Minnesota while the main storm system moved farther west. Once the upper low moved over southwest Minnesota a broader area of precipitation started to develop over central Minnesota where the dendritic growth zone was maximized together with abundant moisture content and lift.

This storm was unique in that widespread blizzard conditions occurred across the upper Midwest including areas from the Brainerd Lakes east towards the North Shore Twin Ports and Interstate 35 corridor with many observed wind gusts between 50 and 70 mph. Very strong frontogenesis occurred along a trowal axis that extended across much of northern Wisconsin west into Minnesota. Warm air advection caused temperatures across most of east-central Minnesota to rise above freezing and produce mixed precipitation for several hours during the day. As the cold front gradually moved east temperatures very quickly dropped and caused treacherous road conditions as mixed precipitation changed over to snow. Narrow bands of heavy snow set up over the Brainerd Lakes northeast towards the Iron Range during the early morning and early afternoon and then translated east towards the Twin Ports North Shore and Interstate 35 corridor. The heavy snow bands coincided with the strong mid-level frontogenesis which also produced very strong northwest winds that caused the widespread blizzard conditions. A maximum gust of 70 mph was recorded at the Bay of Grand Marais during the height of the storm. Damage was reported to buildings and other infrastructure in addition to some power outages and widespread whiteout conditions that made travel difficult if not impossible.||As the cold front swept rapidly eastward bitterly cold air moved into the region and led to the development of a topographically-forced gravity wave during the night of the 23rd that dropped several more inches of snow from Two Harbors to Superior to Holyoke.

The area of the heaviest rain stretched along the Middle Ohio River Valley from central and northeastern Kentucky into southeastern Ohio and western West Virginia.||Common rainfall measurements ranged from 2 to 3 inches across Southeast Ohio. For example in Athens County the Nelsonville cooperative observer measured 2.6 inches of rain while a CoCoRaHS observer in nearby Chauncey reported 2.8 inches. In Meigs County the cooperative observer near Salem Center received 2.08 inches of rain and the Newport observer in Washington County had 2.18 inches in their rain gauge. ||Initially flash flooding closed many roads across Southeast Ohio. Some areas of high water lingering through the 24th as water drained through the river system. Strong rises were seen on local stream gauges such as the Duck Creek at Whipple and the Little Muskingum River at Bloomfield in Washington County. In general the Ohio River rose about 10 feet however no river flooding occurred along the Ohio River.,,24.1737888123429,37.65882764368662,24.1737888123429,10002.0,39.575973,-82.409383,PV Output,9.87,8/27/2012 6:50,3/7/2023 11:00,1761,2082,ac_power_inv_16423,0.0

The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as moderate flooding along the Delaware and Schuylkill Basins and minor to moderate flooding along the Lehigh River Basin. Crests in the upper Schuylkill Lehigh and Delaware River Basins were higher than what occurred with Irene the previous month and the highest crests since late June of 2006 in most instances. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Some of the smaller streams in southeastern Pennsylvania reached major flooding levels but most of those crests were lower than what occurred with Irene.

Its associated strong cold front swept eastward through the Mid Atlantic region and across Pennsylvania during the early morning of the 21st. In addition a secondary area of low pressure formed along the frontal boundary west of Delaware Bay and deepened rapidly. The approaching cold front and the deepening secondary low pressure produced a strong southeasterly flow the reached into the local Philadelphia area and resulted in peak wind gusts of around 50 mph in the far southeast part of the state and knocked down weak tree limbs and wires.  In addition the significant southeast flow allowed water to pile up along the New Jersey shore and into the Delaware Bay and Delaware River and produced major tidal flooding.on the morning of the 21st. Lastly this southeast flow also brought moderate to heavy rain into the state with storm totals ranging between 1 to 3 inches. The rain began during the afternoon of the 20th and fell at its heaviest between Midnight EST and 6 a.m. EST on the 21st. The rain ended between 7 a.m. EST and 9 a.m. EST on the morning of the 21st.

But the combination of the onshore flow and the freshwater runoff caused moderate tidal flooding along the tidal Delaware River with the high tide cycle early on May 1st. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.94 feet above mean lower low water at 306 a.m. EDT on May 1st. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. This was the 7th highest tide on record in Philadelphia. | |The tidal flooding was caused by the combination of a strong high pressure system that built over the Canadian Maritimes that initiated the onshore flow and a strong but slow moving low pressure system. The low pressure system was located in northwest Missouri on the morning of the 29th. It moved northeast to near Chicago during the afternoon of the 29th. The low pressure system then became nearly stationary in southern Wisconsin as its cold front reached Ohio early on the 30th. Then a new low pressure system developed on the frontal boundary and was over Eastern Tennessee on the morning of the 30th. The low pressure system reached West Virginia during the late afternoon on the 30th as its warm front started to move through Delmarva. The low pressure system reached north central Maryland at 11 p.m. EDT on the 30th as its warm front reached extreme southeast Pennsylvania and central New Jersey. The low pressure system reached the Allentown Pennsylvania area at 5 a.m. EDT on May 1st and then was absorbed again into the frontal boundary associated with the original low as it moved into New York State that morning.  The formation of the second low pressure system and the passage of the warm front helped veer the winds from the east to the southeast and enhanced the surface flow that produced the moderate tidal flooding.,,24.388302799896604,24.388302799896604,24.388302799896604,10004.0,39.957501,-75.917354,PV Output,7.65,6/23/2011 6:00,3/7/2023 11:25,1042,3232,ac_power_inv_16425,

On Saturday high temperatures ranged from the mid-70s to mid-80s but only made it to the mid-30s to mid-40s on Sunday. In general there was a 40 degree temperature drop from Saturday to Sunday! ||The backdoor front became stationary south of the region then moved northward as a warm front Sunday night into Monday morning. Meanwhile a strong cold front approached from the west and swept across the area Monday afternoon and evening along with an attendant area of low pressure. This robust storm system tapped large amounts of moisture which was lifted along the warm front as overrunning precipitation and along the cold front as a line of showers and thunderstorms. ||As a result heavy rainfall occurred across the region. A widespread 1 to 3 inches of rainfall occurred with localized amounts over 4 inches. This lead to flooding across portions of the area.

As a deep trough moved into the Southeast US low pressure began to develop off the coast of the Carolinas during the afternoon of January 28. A high amplitude upper level steering pattern caused the developing low to begin moving north-northeastward paralleling the US East Coast. In a classic Nor���easter evolution the developing low phased with a frontal system over the mid-Atlantic as it moved north. This frontal system had brought light snow to portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day on the 28th and it also brought a fresh influx of cold air to the region. As it phased with the developing coastal storm the coastal storm began to explosively intensify as it passed offshore of Delmarva. The strengthening storm spread precipitation back into the region which fell as all snow thanks to the fresh injection of Arctic air. With the center of the low passing a few hundred miles offshore the heaviest snow fell near the coast from the night of the 28th through the morning of the 29th. In eastern New Jersey and coastal Delaware several hours of heavy snow resulted in a widespread swath of 12 to 18 inches of snow. Amounts steadily tapered off heading further inland though some snow fell in all of the local area. In addition with the rapid strengthening of the low strong winds also occurred especially near the coast. Gusts of 40 to 50 mph with a few over 60 mph were observed. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow led to whiteout conditions along the coast and was sufficient for blizzard criteria to be met along both the New Jersey coast and the Delaware Beaches making this the first blizzard to affect any portion of the region since 2018. Snow gradually lost intensity and came to an end during the afternoon of the 29th as the still strengthening low continued moving northward bringing blizzard conditions and even heavier snow to southeast New England.,,10.599743968440388,10.599743968440388,10.599743968440388,10004.0,39.957501,-75.917354,PV Output,7.65,6/23/2011 6:00,3/7/2023 11:25,3871,402,ac_power_inv_16425,inf

A strong negative tilt trough over the Southeast US spurred strong cyclogenesis near the Carolina coast late on January 16. This low would proceed to quickly deepen as it moved northward that evening and night. Upper level steering patterns caused the low to take an ���inside runner��� track which kept the low center inland of the coast. A very strong easterly low level jet developed in between the strengthening low and a departing high pressure center to the north. With the center of the low tracking west of the region and an influx of marine air courtesy of the low level jet various precipitation types occurred during this event. An Arctic air mass had been in place in advance of this system but due to the aforementioned factors that air mass rapidly modified on the 16th. As precipitation arrived temperatures remained cold enough for it to begin as snow in most areas away from the coast. However a rapid transition from snow to mixed precipitation to rain occurred in most areas within hours. Frozen precipitation held on for longer across the interior where some higher snowfall amounts occurred.

The combination of new ice and snow still on the trees from the just concluded winter storm caused a record breaking 715000 customer power outages in the PECO Energy service area in and around Philadelphia (849.000 throughout Pennsylvania). This was the worst power outage event ever for the winter season represented about 45 percent of all its customers and the second worst behind Sandy for the utility. It took about one week to have power fully restored.

Strong winds and minor coastal flooding occurred near Matagorda Bay in Jackson and Matagorda Counties and along the coast of Brazoria and Galveston Counties. Heavy rainfall of over 13 inches caused significant inland flooding in and around the towns of Lolita Edna and Ganado. The maximum sustained wind reported in Matagorda Bay was 45 knots (52 mph). The maximum wind gust of 54 knots (62 mph) was reported on the Bolivar Peninsula at Crab Lake.  There were no reported tornadoes associated with Tropical Storm Bill. ||Storm surge heights ranged from 2.1 feet in Chambers County to 3.2 feet in Galveston County. Roads were flooded and closed around Sargent in Matagorda County. Flood waters rose around homes in the city of Matagorda but no damage was reported. In Brazoria County surge produced minor coastal flooding near Surfside beaches the Treasure Island subdivision and San Luis Pass Park but with little or no damage. In the village of Surfside Beach Seashell Surf and Beach Roads were closed due to high water form storm surge. All countywide beach access roads were closed. Heavy rain caused the flooding of Chocolate and Halls Bayous. There were four trees that were downed by wind. There was minor coastal flooding on the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County with some debris removal required off of State Highway 87. High surf caused erosion of Galveston Island beaches. Sand and debris washed up on the streets of various West End island communities. There was minor flooding damage to downstairs garages in Jamaica Beach with two temporarily closed roads. in Harris County there was minor storm surge flooding in Shoreacres Clear Lake Shores and along Toddville Road in Seabrook.

Cindy's main impact was minor coastal flooding around Galveston Island and especially the Bolivar Peninsula. Storm total rainfall ranged from around one quarter inch at Houston Intercontinental Airport to 4.33 inches on the Bolivar Peninsula with the highest amounts generally across Chambers Galveston and Liberty counties as well as the Bolivar Peninsula. The highest sustained wind of 37 knots (43 mph) was recorded at WeatherFlow site KCRB on the Bolivar Peninsula and the peak gust of 45 knots (52 mph) was recorded at Rollover Pass on the Bolivar Peninsula. The lowest sea-level pressure was 999 mb at Galveston Scholes Field. Minor coastal flooding was the tropical storm's main impact. Despite predominant offshore winds long period swells and associated wave run up led to a rise in water levels along Gulf facing beaches. In addition a persistent northerly wind component lead to a pile up of water on north facing Bay side beaches. Water and debris covered a low lying section of Highway 87 near its intersection with Highway 124 which is an area that is especially vulnerable to coastal flooding. Elsewhere channels were elevated around Jamaica Beach and other west end communities of Galveston Island but there was little impact.

Harvey began the period as a Category 2 storm and was a mid range Category 3 storm as it headed toward the Texas Coastal Bend region where it would make landfall as a 938 mb Category 4 wrecking ball near Rockport. ||The outskirts of Harvey produced tropical storm force gusts measured and estimated at 41 to 46 mph on South Padre Island to the western shoreline of Laguna Madre in Cameron County with gusts from 48 to 63 mph along the coast of Kenedy County including the Laguna Madre shoreline.  Here sustained tropical storm force winds of 39 to 51 mph were reported at shoreline buoys.  No damage was reported in these areas which are vastly unpopulated.||Within the tropical storm force (sustained) wind area other impacts included nuisance tidal overwash that ran into the dunes on the barrier island (South Padre and the Padre Island National Seashore north of Port Mansfield) with storm surge measured at 1.77 feet above predicted tide.  At Baffin Bay the tide level peaked at 1.77 feet above Mean Sea Level which likely equated to 2 feet of storm surge (based on similar reports farther south). No damage or beach erosion was reported at the Cameron County public and resort areas of South Padre but there may have been minor erosion along the Kenedy County coast.

Some storms became strong to severe in the rather favorable convective environment posing a primary risk of damaging winds along with some hail. Convection also continued well into the overnight over portions of the area thanks to the good shear and forcing with convection eventually moving offshore in the pre-dawn hours of the 15th.,,8.064292232358836,3.0566982798356483,3.0566982798356483,10007.0,40.246036,-74.030719,PV Output,10.34,6/9/2011 21:30,3/7/2023 12:15,3658,630,ac_power_inv_16428,4.785060035570462

Peak wind gusts reached around 70 mph and downed trees tree limbs and wires and caused some structural damage. About 50000 homes and businesses lost power. Power was restored by the 7th. Because of the adverse weather New Jersey Transit cross honored rail and bus tickets. Trash pick-ups were postponed. At least minor tidal flooding persisted into the morning high tide cycle on the 10th.  This was the greatest and most persistent tidal flooding to affect the New Jersey coast since Hurricane Sandy last October. ||Minor tidal flooding started with the high tide cycle on the morning of the 6th in Cape May County. Widespread minor tidal flooding occurred with the afternoon high tide cycle on the 6th and then areas of moderate tidal flooding occurred  during the morning high tide cycle on the 7th. This high tide cycle caused the most road closures. Minor tidal flooding also occurred with both high tide cycles on the 8th. On top of the tidal flooding was wave action as well as heavy rain. In addition the persistent north to northeast winds prevented the back bays from emptying. The highest tide at Cape May (Cape May County) reached 7.54 feet above mean lower low water and at Sandy Hook (Monmouth County) 7.63 feet above mean lower low water. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.7 feet above mean lower low water. The highest tide at Atlantic City (Atlantic County) reached 6.95 feet above mean lower low water.

Strong wind gusts started late in the evening on the 14th peaked during the morning of the 15th and continued into the afternoon of the 15th. The highest winds occurred in the southern half of the state and in the higher terrain of Sussex County.  In these latter locations peak wind gusts averaged around 60 mph. In the rest of the northern half of the state peak wind gusts averaged 45 to 50 mph. The strong to high winds caused isolated property damage (mainly stripped siding) knocked down or snapped numerous trees and tree limbs. This resulted in downed wires and power outages. About 5000 homes and businesses lost power mainly in southeast New Jersey.  Nearly all power was restored on the evening of the 15th. The strong to high winds hampered road crews trying to keep roadways clear from the snow that fell on the 14th. It also ushered into New Jersey one of the coldest air masses of the entire winter season. ||In Cape May County a hotel roof was partially torn off in Stone Harbor.  New Jersey State Route 47 was closed in Middle Township because of a downed pole. Service was suspended on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry. In Atlantic City (Atlantic County) the high winds knocked down a street light electrical box. The wind also caused the cancellation of several events.

This large and very deep area of low pressure moved slowly east over the open waters of the North Atlantic Ocean through Sunday March 4th. This lead to a variety of weather hazards during this time frame.||Strong Northwest winds with gusts up to around 60 mph occurred on March 2nd and 3rd. This led to widespread damage to trees and power lines causing extensive power outages across the region.||Minor coastal flooding over multiple tide cycles occurred along the New Jersey coast March 2nd through 4th. Moderate flooding occurred during the morning high tide of Saturday the 3rd in Monmouth County most of the NJ oceanfront Saturday evening and again Sunday morning the 4th.

The low steadily but not rapidly intensified as it moved north. Plentiful moisture was associated with the low thanks to a Gulf of Mexico connection. In addition very strong high pressure was centered just north of New England which helped lock in cold air over the mid-Atlantic. The combination of the moisture-rich low and cold air in place led to a significant winter storm over much of the mid-Atlantic. Heavy snow and sleet fell over the area with some areas also changing to rain as warmer ocean air surged inland and warmer air moved in aloft. While the central pressure of the storm system was not especially low (around 995 mb) the gradient between the low pressure and the very strong high to the north also led to strong winds in the region especially near the coast.

A cold front moved through the region in the predawn hours of April 30 associated with low pressure moving into coastal New England. An upper level disturbance and a secondary cold front then approached late in the day on the 30th. This system interacted with the departing low pressure over New England causing that low to rapidly intensify as it began moving towards the Canadian maritimes. With high pressure over the Midwest this led to a very strong pressure gradient over the mid-Atlantic. Combined with strong dynamics associated with the secondary cold front a lengthy period of windy conditions developed for much of the day on the 30th. Widespread wind gusts of 45 to 55 mph with some gusts of 60 to 65 mph occurred. This combined with many trees across the region already bearing leaves led to numerous instances of tree damage and power outages across the region.

Later on the 24th a secondary area of low pressure began to develop over the Southeast along the trailing cold front from the primary low. This low steadily intensified as it moved north along the Appalachians and it passed over the interior mid-Atlantic on the night of the 24th into the early morning of the 25th. Meanwhile the cold front continued to approach as the secondary low tracked along it. Strong high pressure was also located well offshore over the Atlantic. In the strong gradient between the low pressure to the west and the high pressure to the east a near record strong southerly low level jet began to develop. This led to an unusually intense cold season southerly high wind event over portions of the mid-Atlantic as despite some degree of stabilization in the lowest levels of the atmosphere strong gusts associated with the low level jet were still observed at the surface. In addition to the high winds the long fetch of southerly flow drew an atmospheric river of unseasonably high moisture values into the mid-Atlantic leading to heavy rain across the region.

Its associated strong cold front swept eastward through the Mid Atlantic region and across New Jersey during the early morning of the 21st.  In addition a secondary area of low pressure formed along the frontal boundary west of Delaware Bay and deepened rapidly.  The approaching cold front and the deepening secondary low pressure produced a strong southeasterly flow over the region that resulted in peak wind gusts ranging from 46 mph to 64 mph across the state.  About 35000 homes and businesses lost power because of downed trees tree limbs and wires. In addition the significant southeast flow allowed water to pile up along the New Jersey shore and into Delaware Bay producing minor to moderate coastal flooding at the time of high tide on the morning of the 21st.  Tidal flooding increased further along tidal sections of the Delaware River as major flooding occurred. Moderate to heavy rain fell across the state with storm totals ranging between 1 to 3 inches.  This rain resulted in some mainly minor flooding of smaller streams and creeks in southern New Jersey.||The strong onshore flow contributed to higher high tides with minor to moderate tidal flooding occurring along the southern New Jersey oceanfront and in Barnegat Bay.

Strong winds and minor tidal flooding started with the daytime high tide cycle on the 1st. The winds and minor to moderate tidal flooding both peaked on the 2nd. Slow improvement in conditions occurred through Sunday the 4th with only some residual minor tidal flooding occurring on the 5th along the southern New Jersey coast. ||In excess of 32 million dollars in storm damage occurred along the New Jersey coast especially along the coasts of Cape May Ocean and Monmouth Counties due to the prolonged wind and tidal flooding which caused extensive damage to New Jersey's coastal barrier dune system. As a result Governor Chris Christie announced that New Jersey would request a Major Disaster Declaration under the federal Stafford Act for these three shore counties. To restore traffic flow and prevent further flooding in these counties sand removal was performed along storm drains and roadways. In North Wildwood (Cape May County) severe beach erosion occurred leaving 5 foot or higher cliffs carved out of the dunes along sections of the beach making those areas unsafe and inaccessible. The beaches at Mantoloking and Brick (Ocean County) were closed following the storm due to dangerous drop-offs between a protective steel flood wall and the beach. The severe beach erosion at these locations resulted in drop-offs ranging between 5 to 10 feet. Meanwhile in the Toms River community of Ortley Beach (Ocean County) on the northern barrier island a breach reportedly occurred in the temporary dune line the township had constructed. In Middle Township (Cape May County) a vacant and structurally unsound home was dislodged from its pilings in the Grassy Sound Channel behind North Wildwood on the 2nd and it floated into the Intracoastal Waterway before it broke apart and settled into the marsh.

Low pressure tracking out of the Ohio Valley weakened as it moved slowly eastward on the 31st. Meanwhile as that low weakened secondary low pressure began to develop off the coast of the Carolinas and tracked northward just off the mid-Atlantic coast. The low steadily intensified as it moved up the coast in a classic ���Miller B��� storm evolution. The result was a significant and unusually long duration winter storm. Overrunning precipitation associated with the initial low over the Ohio Valley impacted the region on the 31st. A cold antecedent air mass allowed most of this precipitation to fall as snow. This produced widespread snow accumulation though the overrunning precipitation was mostly of the light to moderate variety. Some areas experienced a lull in precipitation on the overnight of the 31st as the secondary low began to develop and a dry slot overspread a large area. In addition a surge of warmer air both at the surface and aloft caused precipitation to change to sleet or rain in some areas especially locations farthest south and east such as the Delmarva peninsula and southern New Jersey. However as the secondary low strengthened heavy precipitation developed on February 1 with intense banding and areas of extreme snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches per hour in northern New Jersey and portions of eastern Pennsylvania. Precipitation eventually turned back to snow all the way to the coastline as colder air was drawn in from the north. The secondary low pressure nearly stalled off the mid-Atlantic coast causing snow to continue into February 2 although by then snowfall rates were much lighter and additional accumulation was limited.

Progressively lighter snowfall amounts occurred farther to the north and west.  Snow to liquid water equivalent ratios were high with this event creating an incredibly dry and fluffy snow. Ratios across southern New Jersey ranged from around 20:1 to 30:1 with closer to 10:1 to 20:1 ratios farther inland and northward. One person used his leaf blower to clear three inches of snow in Manasquan (Monmouth County).|  |With cold temperatures in place snow accumulated quickly leading to slippery and snow covered roadways.  There were speed reductions along the Garden State Parkway and New Jersey Turnpike. Because the snow fell overnight the total number of accidents was relatively low.  The overnight snow caused schools in the southern part of the state to have delayed openings on the morning of the 29th.

Impacts from the storm came mainly in two phases. Initially weakening low pressure moved into the Midwest and Great Lakes region on December 1 bringing a widespread area of overrunning precipitation to the mid-Atlantic. Cold air in place ahead of the precipitation led to heavy mixed precipitation in interior areas with most though not all areas eventually seeing a gradual change to rain. On December 2nd developing secondary low pressure brought additional precipitation to the region which took the form of rain changing to snow.

Low pressure tracking out of the Ohio Valley weakened as it moved slowly eastward on the 31st. Meanwhile as that low weakened secondary low pressure began to develop off the coast of the Carolinas and tracked northward just off the mid-Atlantic coast. The low steadily intensified as it moved up the coast in a classic ���Miller B��� storm evolution. The result was a significant and unusually long duration winter storm. Overrunning precipitation associated with the initial low over the Ohio Valley impacted the region on the 31st. A cold antecedent air mass allowed most of this precipitation to fall as snow. This produced widespread snow accumulation though the overrunning precipitation was mostly of the light to moderate variety. Some areas experienced a lull in precipitation on the overnight of the 31st as the secondary low began to develop and a dry slot overspread a large area. In addition a surge of warmer air both at the surface and aloft caused precipitation to change to sleet or rain in some areas especially locations farthest south and east such as the Delmarva peninsula and southern New Jersey. However as the secondary low strengthened heavy precipitation developed on February 1 with intense banding and areas of extreme snowfall rates of 2 to 4 inches per hour in northern New Jersey and portions of eastern Pennsylvania. Precipitation eventually turned back to snow all the way to the coastline as colder air was drawn in from the north. The secondary low pressure nearly stalled off the mid-Atlantic coast causing snow to continue into February 2 although by then snowfall rates were much lighter and additional accumulation was limited. Areas where precipitation remained all snow and that experienced the heavy banding saw extreme snowfall totals with isolated amounts of near 3 feet of snow and a fairly widespread swath of in excess of 2 feet.

The low steadily intensified as it gained latitude and a sizeable shield of banded precipitation developed in its northwest quadrant. This resulted in a fairly short duration period of precipitation over the eastern mid-Atlantic but with precipitation rates that were moderate to heavy at times. The storm produced a wide swath of several inches of snow with considerable local variations in the snow totals. The variations were due to both distinct banding features as well as marginally cold temperatures especially near the coast which caused precipitation to start as rain in some areas.

As a deep trough moved into the Southeast US low pressure began to develop off the coast of the Carolinas during the afternoon of January 28. A high amplitude upper level steering pattern caused the developing low to begin moving north-northeastward paralleling the US East Coast. In a classic Nor���easter evolution the developing low phased with a frontal system over the mid-Atlantic as it moved north. This frontal system had brought light snow to portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day on the 28th and it also brought a fresh influx of cold air to the region. As it phased with the developing coastal storm the coastal storm began to explosively intensify as it passed offshore of Delmarva. The strengthening storm spread precipitation back into the region which fell as all snow thanks to the fresh injection of Arctic air. With the center of the low passing a few hundred miles offshore the heaviest snow fell near the coast from the night of the 28th through the morning of the 29th. In eastern New Jersey and coastal Delaware several hours of heavy snow resulted in a widespread swath of 12 to 18 inches of snow. Amounts steadily tapered off heading further inland though some snow fell in all of the local area. In addition with the rapid strengthening of the low strong winds also occurred especially near the coast. Gusts of 40 to 50 mph with a few over 60 mph were observed. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow led to whiteout conditions along the coast and was sufficient for blizzard criteria to be met along both the New Jersey coast and the Delaware Beaches making this the first blizzard to affect any portion of the region since 2018.

The onshore flow did cause minor tidal flooding during the high tide cycle during the pre-dawn hours on the 27th as well as some beach erosion.||Snow began falling during the early morning on the 26th. In the southern half of the state precipitation actually started as rain the evening before. While it snowed most of the day on the 26th there were times where it briefly stopped or the intensity was very light. The snow fell at its steadiest and heaviest as bands backed into the state during the early and mid morning on the 27th. The snow ended late in the morning on the 27th in the southern third of the state and during the early afternoon of the 27th elsewhere. ||In anticipation of a greater impact to the state a state of emergency was declared by Governor Chris Christie. This authorizes the New Jersey director of emergency management to activate and coordinate the preparation response and recovery efforts from the storm with all of the county and municipal emergency operations and government agencies. On the 26th staggered dismissal of state employees began. Many schools dismissed early. Local government and school administrators cancelled public meetings. Social activities and after school activities were also cancelled.

Snowfall totals primarily between 4 to 7 inches occurred across central to southern New Jersey with mainly less than 4 inches occurring across northern New Jersey. The snow caused accidents and impacted the morning commute on the 17th. ||On the 17th state as well as many municipal offices had delayed openings. Hundreds of schools in the central and southern part of the state either were closed or had delayed openings. Many township and school board meetings were postponed. Speed restrictions were in place on the Garden State Parkway New Jersey Turnpike and Delaware Memorial Bridge. New Jersey Transit also cross-honored commuter tickets. Trash and recycling pick-ups were delayed.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County Mercer County (two) Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287 the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike.

An ocean wave associated with it injured a father and his son at Barnegat Inlet (Ocean County). The tidal departure caused by the meteotsunami ranged from three inches to one foot along the New Jersey coast but some rough surf and higher waves occurred at the time of its occurrence.||The meteotsunami was believed induced by a weak end derecho that moved off the New Jersey coast at about 11 a.m. EDT on the morning of the 13th. The surface pressure fluctuation caused by this phenomenon was believed to have triggered it. The worst reported incident with the meteotsunami occurred in Ocean County at Barnegat Inlet at around 330 p.m. EDT on the 13th. A man was spear fishing near the mouth of Barnegat Inlet just south of a submerged northern breakwater.  The outgoing tide (high tide was at about Noon EDT) was amplified by strong currents which carried divers over the submerged breakwater (normally 3-4 feet deep). This strong outrush continued for about two minutes and eventually the rocks in the submerged breakwater were exposed.  At this point the eyewitness noticed a large wave coming in approximately six feet peak-to-trough and spanned across the inlet. The upper two feet of the wave was breaking. This wave occurred in conjunction with a reversal of the current such that even though the tide was receding a strong surge was entering the inlet. This surge carried the divers back over the submerged reef and into the inlet from where they were rescued. On the south jetty three people were swept off the rocks which were 5 to 6 feet above sea level at the time into the ocean on the beach side of the jetty.  A father and son were injured and required medical treatment.  Both made it to shore on their own. The father suffered rib injuries and a punctured lung and was flown by helicopter to Jersey South Hospital. The 10-year-old son suffered a cut leg and cheek and was taken by a,,8.064292232358836,8.064292232358836,8.064292232358836,10007.0,40.246036,-74.030719,PV Output,10.34,6/9/2011 21:30,3/7/2023 12:15,734,3553,ac_power_inv_16428,3.2746170219135156
